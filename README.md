 Players already on the list will have their days subtracted until they are removed from the list, making them ineligible to be added again in the future. It will be up to you to not use the player for those 3 days, leaving you with a 24 man roster during that time. Because your team will be shorthanded I have kept the bereavement list to 3 days instead of the 3-7 days allowed by Major League Baseball. This is why I do not have the 7 day concussion list here. For those that are wondering, MLB allows for teams to temporarily promote a player from their 40 man roster to the MLB team until the player on bereavement/paternity leave returns.
